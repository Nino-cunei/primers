What are we doing in the primers?
=================================

The primers in Nino-cunei focus on specific research questions and are meant to
complement the tutorials, which describe the computational tools.

For a survey of these tools, start with [tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/annotation/tutorials/blob/master/oldbabylonian/start.ipynb).

All materials in Nino-cunei are drawn from the open data sources
at [CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu), the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative.

Two very different types of material have been investigated so far: the Proto-Cuneiform
materials, in their entirety, from ca. 3300-3000 BCE have been looked at
in the primers in the "uruk" folder, while the "oldbabylonian" folder includes 
roughly half of the AbB corpus of Old Babylonian letters.

Software
========

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric/).

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.
